## Phase 1: Planning and Setup (Weeks 1–2)
**Goal:** Establish a clear roadmap and project foundation.

### Week 1: Project Definition
* Research encryption methods to visualise (e.g. Caesar cipher, RSA, AES).
* Define the SPA's core features:
  * Interactive input for encryption/decryption.
  * Step-by-step visual representation.
  * A clean, responsive UI.
* Sketch basic layouts for the UI.

### Week 2: Development Environment Setup
* Create a Git repository for version control.
* Set up the project folder structure:
  * `/css/`
  * `/js/`
  * `/assets/` (if required for icons/images).
* Build a static HTML skeleton to be used as the base template.

## Phase 2: Core Features Implementation (Weeks 3–10)
**Goal:** Build and test the encryption and visualisation features.

### Week 3: Inputs and Outputs
* Create text input fields for user data (plaintext or ciphertext).
* Add dropdowns or buttons to select encryption algorithms.
* Style the inputs/outputs with CSS.

### Week 4: Basic Algorithm Implementation
* Implement a simple algorithm (e.g. Caesar cipher) in JavaScript.
* Write functions for encryption and decryption logic.
* Display results dynamically in the output section.

### Weeks 5–6: Interactive Visualisation for the First Algorithm
* Create a visual representation of the Caesar cipher:
  * Highlight letters in the input text.
  * Display the shifted characters.
  * Show the encryption process step-by-step.
* Add animation using CSS and JavaScript.
* Test user interaction (e.g. pausing/replaying visualisation).

### Weeks 7–8: Additional Encryption Algorithms
* Add one or two more algorithms, such as:
  * Substitution cipher.
  * RSA (visualize modular arithmetic steps).
* Create unique visualisation styles for each algorithm.

### Weeks 9–10: Responsive Design and Accessibility
* Use CSS media queries to make the SPA mobile-friendly.
* Test and refine the design for accessibility (e.g. proper labels, ARIA roles).

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Polish (Weeks 11–14)
**Goal:** Enhance functionality and refine user experience.

### Weeks 11–12: Step Control and Playback
* Add controls to pause, play, and step through the visualisation process.
* Implement a progress bar or timeline for visual progress tracking.

### Week 13: Customisation Options
* Allow users to set parameters for algorithms (e.g. shift value for Caesar cipher).
* Add input validation for user-entered values.
  
### Week 14: Code Cleanup and Refactoring
* Optimise JavaScript code for readability and performance.
* Modularise functions into reusable modules.

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (Weeks 15–18)
**Goal:** Finalise, test, and deploy the application.

### Week 15: Testing
* Unit tests for encryption and decryption functions.
* Perform user testing to ensure intuitive functionality.
* Fix bugs and edge cases.

### Week 16: Final UI Enhancements
* Add finishing touches to the UI (e.g. animations, color schemes).
* Ensure the SPA aligns with the initial vision.

### Week 17: Documentation
* Write clear documentation for the SPA, including:
  * How the app works.
  * Details on implemented algorithms.
  * Known limitations and potential improvements.
    
### Week 18: Deployment and Feedback
* Deploy the SPA.
* Collect feedback for future updates.
  
## Deliverables by the End of Each Phase
1. **Phase 1:** Wireframes, project structure, and static HTML template.
2. **Phase 2:** Fully functional encryption and visualisation for multiple algorithms.
3. **Phase 3:** Polished SPA with playback controls and customisation features.
4. **Phase 4:** Tested and deployed application with documentation.
