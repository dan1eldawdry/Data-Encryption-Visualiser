## Phase 1: Planning and Setup (Weeks 1–2)
**Goal:** Create a roadmap and foundation.

### Week 1: Project Definition
* Research encryption methods to visualise (e.g. Caesar cipher, RSA, AES).
* Define the core features:
  * Interactive input for encryption/decryption.
  * Step by step visual representation.
  * A clean and responsive UI.
* design basic layouts for the UI.

### Week 2: Development Environment Setup
* Create a Git repository.
* Set up the project folder structure:
  * `/css/`
  * `/js/`
  * `/assets/` (if I need to use images)
* Build a static HTML skeleton to use as a base template.

## Phase 2: Core Features Implementation (Weeks 3–10)
**Goal:** Build and test the encryption and visualisation features.

### Week 3: Inputs and Outputs
* Create text input fields for user data.
* Add buttons to select encryption algorithms.
* Style the inputs/outputs with CSS.

### Week 4: Basic Algorithm Implementation
* Implement a simple algorithm (e.g. Caesar cipher) in JavaScript.
* Write functions for encryption and decryption.
* Display results dynamically in output section.

### Weeks 5–6: Interactive Visualisation for the First Algorithm
* Create a visual representation of Caesar cipher:
  * Highlight letters in the input text.
  * Display the shifted characters.
  * Show the encryption process step by step.
* Add animation using CSS and JavaScript.
* Test user interaction like pausing/replaying visualisation.

### Weeks 7–9: Additional Encryption Algorithms
* Add one or two more algorithms (apply the same process as Caesar Cipher), such as:
  * Substitution cipher.
  * Vigenere Cipher.

### Weeks 10–11: Responsive Design and Accessibility
* Use CSS media queries to make the SPA better on mobile.
* Test and refine the design for accessibility.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Polish (Weeks 11–14)
 **Goal:** Better functionality and refine user experience.

### Weeks 12: Step Control and Playback
* Add controls to pause, play, and step through the visualisation process.

### Week 13: Customisation Options
* Allow users to set parameters for algorithms like the shift value for Caesar cipher.
* Add input validation for user entered input.
  
### Week 14: Code Cleanup
* Optimise JavaScript code.
* Turn functions into reusable modules.

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (Weeks 15–18)
**Goal:** Finalise and test the website.

### Week 15: Testing
* Tests for encryption and decryption functions.
* Perform user testing to ensure functionality.
* Fix bugs

### Week 16: Final UI Enhancements
* Add finishing touches to the UI (e.g. animations, color schemes).
* Ensure the SPA keeps with the initial vision.
  
## Deliverables by the End of Each Phase
1. **Phase 1:** Wireframes, project structure, and static HTML template.
2. **Phase 2:** Fully functional encryption and visualisation for multiple algorithms.
3. **Phase 3:** Polished SPA with playback controls and customisation features.
4. **Phase 4:** Tested and deployed application with documentation.
